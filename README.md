# F1-AeroFlow
Neural F1 Optimizer is a multi-agent AI system that accelerates Formula 1 aerodynamic design by replacing 12-hour CFD simulations with real-time Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Orchestrated by SpoonOS, a chain of specialized agents autonomously analyzes component images, simulates airflow in milliseconds.
